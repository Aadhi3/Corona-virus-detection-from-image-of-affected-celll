# Corona detection from affected cell image 

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for detecting the presence of the coronavirus in cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The proposed system is designed to help healthcare professionals identify COVID-19 infected patients quickly and accurately, by analyzing cell images.

The project involves collecting cell images that have been infected with the coronavirus and normal cell images. The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources or from healthcare facilities. The dataset is then preprocessed to remove noise and improve image quality.

The preprocessed images are then used to train a CNN model. The CNN model is designed to learn the features that distinguish COVID-19 infected cells from normal cells. The model is trained using various architectures like VGG, ResNet, etc., and optimized using loss functions like cross-entropy.

After training, the model is tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model is then fine-tuned based on the performance evaluation results to improve its performance.

Once the model is optimized, it can be used to classify new cell images into COVID-19 infected or normal categories. The classification can be done either manually or automatically using the model. The model can be integrated into a web application or a mobile application to make it accessible to healthcare professionals.

Overall, this project aims to develop a reliable, accurate, and efficient system for detecting the presence of COVID-19 in cells using deep learning algorithms. The code and results of the project will be made available on GitHub, making it easier for researchers and healthcare professionals to further develop and improve upon the proposed system.
